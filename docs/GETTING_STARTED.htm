<p><h3>What should I do?
</h3><br>
<p>
If you downloaded executables, you can put them in your %EUDIR%\bin\ directory and
run them from the command line just like you would with the normal RDS interpreters.
I recommend putting the source in its own directory.  You can then develop other
programs in the same directory, and run them:
<div class="box"><pre>
   exw eu.ex my_app.exw
</pre></div>
This can get messy, however.  It is recommended that you either put the code that you're
working on in a subdirectory or a sibling directory of the directory where you put the
source.  Then you can run the app:
<div class="box"><pre>
  exw eu.ex subdirectory\my_app.exw
  exu eu.ex ../siblingdirectory/my_app.exu 
</pre></div>
There are several demos included to demonstrate the features of ooeu:
<ul>
 <li> class.ex
 <li> eval.exw
 <li> shape.ex
 </ul> 
If you've downloaded the binary files, you'll need to put them in your path (on Windows,
you can simply put them all in your euphoria\bin directory).  Under Linux, you should put
 all of the shared libraries (.so files) in the <a href="#USR">usr</a>/lib directory.  You'll need to have
root access to do this.  Here is a list of the binary files, and the recommended place
to do put them:
<ul>
 <li> Interpreter (oexu/oexw) Put in your euphoria/bin directory, where you have your
normal Euphoria interpreter.
 <li> Debugger wxEuphoria Library (wxooeu.dll/so) Put the dll in your euphoria/bin directory, and the so in
 <a href="#USR">usr</a>/lib.
 <li> Debugger Library (ooeu_trace.dll/so) Put the dll in your euphoria/bin directory, and the so in
 <a href="#USR">usr</a>/lib.
 <li> Embedded Library (libooeu.dll/so)  Put the dll in your euphoria/bin directory, and the so in
 <a href="#USR">usr</a>/lib.
 </ul>
