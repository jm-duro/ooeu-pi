You can bind or shroud code so that it can start up faster later (the parsing is
already done).  This is done by using command line options:
<div class="box"><pre>
  -s shroud
  -c shroud without deleting any symbol information
  -b bind
</pre></div>
The option must come before your source file:
<div class="box"><pre>
  exw eu.ex -s my_file.exw
  oexw -c win32lib.ew
  oexw -b my_file.exw
</pre></div>
When shrouding, the file will have the same base name, but with the extension ".oe".
A bound file will have the ".exe" extension added on Windows and DOS, and there
will be no extension for Linux.  You must bind using an executable
(bound or compiled should be fine) version of the interpreter, since that executable will
have the shrouded code appended to it.  The resulting file will be in the same directory
as the source file.
<p>
Additionally, immediately after the -s or -b option, you may specify the -full_debug
option.  This will preserve the source lines for lines where "with trace" is in effect,
and you will get a normal traceback of the last 10 lines in the ex.err file.
